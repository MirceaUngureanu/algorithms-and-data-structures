A graph is a collection of nodes and connections between them.

Uses:
- social networks
- location / mapping
- routing algorithms
- visual hierarchy
- file system optimisation
- recommendations engines

Terms:
- vertex = a node
- edge = connection between nodes
- directed/undirected = directions assigned to distances between vertices
- weighted/unweighted = values assigned to distances between vertices

The two most common way to store graphs are adjacency list and adjacency matrix.
