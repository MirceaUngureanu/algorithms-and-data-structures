Hash tables are key-value data stores. Each language has its own implementation of a hash table.
Hash table offer human readability of key while also maintaining computer readability by indexing via a number under the hood.

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. The values are used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table.

Using prime numbers for the length of our array reduces change of collisions.
