- we only care about the trends e.g.
linear search
O(1)   O(N)   O(N)
best  average  worst
- consider worst case scenario
- ignore constants and simplify

O(log N) = log base 2 of N
2 to what power gives us N
e.g. if we have to do a binary search of an array of 16 items it will take a maximum of 4 steps
because 2^4 = 16 === log base 2 of 16 = 4
